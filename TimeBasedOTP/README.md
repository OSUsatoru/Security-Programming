--- explicit instructions on how to run your program ---

To generate a jpg picture of the QR code that encodes the URL GA expects.

    python main.py --generate-qr [userID]

To generate an OTP which must match the OTP generated by the Google Authenticator
for that 30 second period and print it to the screen

    python main.py --get-otp [userID]

(userID is optional argument)

--- to debug both features ---
1. Generate QR code.
2. Use Google Authenticator to read QR code
3. Run command to generate an OTP when Google Authenticator generates new OTP.
4. Google Authenticator and my program must disuplay the same 6 digits of OTP.

---  explain your implementation briefly ---

This program generates OTP by using information from RFC 6238 documentation.
I implemented HOTP to generate OTP by using Base32 string secret key
and counter that is the moving factor. By replacing counter to the integer value T where
T = (Current time - T0) / time_step, I implemented TOTP.

Generated OTP is sychronized with the OTP displayed by Google Authenticator with generaged QR code.
